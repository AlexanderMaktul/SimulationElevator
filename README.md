# SimulationElevator

# Overview

The `SimulationElevator` project is a simulation of an elevator management system. The system handles multiple elevators and processes requests to move the elevators to different floors based on user input. The project includes an elevator manager, elevator service, and interfaces to facilitate the management and operation of elevators.

 Features

- Manages multiple elevators.
- Handles both panel and wall requests.
- Simulates elevator journeys.
- Provides real-time status updates of elevators.
- Implements dependency injection for better modularity and testability.
